    <p class="poemtitle"> Pearls</p>
    <p class="author"> Sarah Baugh</p>
    <p class="poem"> The world is your oyster
        <br> What does that mean?
        <br> Is there a pearl hidden in every dark place?
        <br> Or is the world only what we want it to be
        <br> If we have the pearls to pay for  it?
        <br> If we pry something open
        <br> That is shut tightly
        <br> And is dark
        <br> Mysterious
        <br> Will we always find something beautiful?
        <br> Not ever oyster holds a pearl.
        <br> Is it the promise of something beautiful
        <br> That keeps us searching for oysters
        <br> In this world?
        <br> Not every pearl is in an oyster.
        <br>

        <p class="poemtitle"> Real Happiness</p>
        <p class="author"> Shashikant Nishant Sharma</p>
        <p class="poem"> Happiness lies in good health
            <br> Not in accumulation of wealth
            <br> Happiness lies in caring for others
            <br> Like dear friends and brothers
            <br> Happiness lies in sharing
            <br> Not is amassing
            <br> Happiness is the state of mind
            <br> Nowhere else you can find
            <br> Enjoy the moment, live the life
            <br> Settle score and end the strife
            <br> Happiness is the journey not destination
            <br> Happiness is doing what is your fascination
            <br> Happiness is doing what you Like
            <br> Sleeping,walking,running and riding a bike
            <br> Happiness will come near
            <br> When you will venture without fear
            <br> Render service that you can
            <br> Live a life that adorn a man
            <br>
        </p>
